# TaxCalcBR

## Financial System to Calculate Interest Rate

### Description
TaxCalcBR is a Python-based project that simplifies retrieving and calculating Brazilian financial indices, such as the SELIC and CDI rates. The tool provides automation, statistical insights, and a web-based graphical interface to assist financial planning, investment decision-making, and economic analysis.

### Features
- **Interactive user menu**: Allows users to provide information about interest rates, purchases, and installment payments.
- **Compound interest**: Calculates the annualized SELIC rate using compound interest formulas.
- **Flexible input handling**: Supports user-friendly formats for financial data (e.g., values with commas or dots).
- **Interactive web interface**: Enables users to interact with the system through a modern, responsive interface.

### System modeling
The system processes input data to convert rates for different periods (e.g., annual to monthly) and performs cumulative calculations, such as annualized returns based on compound interest principles.

### Data manipulation
- **Data cleaning**: Ensures raw data is stripped of unnecessary characters and formatted consistently.
- **Financial calculations**: Implements formulas for accurate and reliable financial projections.

### Web Interface
The project includes a web-based graphical interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
- **Dynamic inputs**: Adjusts fields dynamically based on user selections (e.g., enabling or disabling discount or interest rate inputs).
- **Real-time calculations**: Performs calculations and displays results dynamically without requiring page reloads.
- **Smooth navigation**: Automatically scrolls to results after calculations.

### Goals
The primary goal of TaxCalcBR is to offer a streamlined, accurate, and user-friendly platform for managing and analyzing financial indices in Brazil. By automating rate retrieval and calculations, TaxCalcBR empowers users to make informed financial decisions effortlessly.
