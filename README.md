# TaxCalcBR

## Financial System to Calculate Interest Rate

### Description
TaxCalcBR is a Python-based project that simplifies retrieving and calculating Brazilian financial indices, such as the SELIC and CDI rates. 
The tool provides automation, statistical insights, and a web-based graphical interface to assist financial planning, investment decision-making, and economic analysis.

### Features
- **User interaction menu**: The user informs the interest, purchase, and installment rates.
- **Compound interest**: Calculates the annualized SELIC rate using compound interest formulas.
- **Flexible input handling**: Supports user-friendly input formats for financial data (e.g., values with commas or points).
- **Interactive web interface**: Allows users to interact with the system through a modern, responsive graphical interface.

### System modeling
The system processes the data to convert rates for different periods (e.g., annual to monthly) and performs cumulative calculations such as annualized returns using compound interest principles.

### Data manipulation
- **Data cleaning**: Ensures raw data is stripped of extraneous characters and formatted consistently.
- **Financial calculations**: Implements formulas for accurate and reliable financial projections.

### Web Interface
The project includes a web-based graphical interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
- **Dynamic inputs**: Automatically adjusts fields based on user choices (e.g., enabling/disabling discount or interest rate inputs).
- **Real-time calculations**: Performs calculations and displays results dynamically without page reloads.
- **Smooth navigation**: Automatically scrolls to results after calculations.

### Goals
The main goal of TaxCalcBR is to provide a streamlined, accurate, and user-friendly platform for managing and analyzing financial indices in Brazil. 
By automating the retrieval and calculation of crucial rates, TaxCalcBR empowers users to make informed financial decisions with minimal effort.
