# TaxCalcBR

## Financial System to Calculate Interest Rate

### Description
TaxCalcBR is a Python-based project designed to simplify retrieving and calculating Brazilian financial indices, such as the SELIC and CDI rates. 
The tool provides automation and statistical insights to assist financial planning, investment decision-making, and economic analysis.

### Features
- **User interaction menu**: The user informs the interest, purchase, and installment rates.
- **Compound interest**: Calculates the annualized SELIC rate using compound interest formulas.
- **Flexible input handling**: Supports user-friendly input formats for financial data (e.g., values with commas or points).

### System modeling
The system processes the data to convert rates for different periods (e.g., annual to monthly) and performs cumulative calculations such as annualized returns using compound interest principles.

### Data manipulation
- **Data cleaning**: Ensures raw data is stripped of extraneous characters and formatted consistently.
- **Financial calculations**: Implements formulas for accurate and reliable financial projections.

### Goals
The main goal of TaxCalcBR is to provide a streamlined, accurate, and user-friendly platform for managing and analyzing financial indices in Brazil. 
By automating the retrieval and calculation of crucial rates, TaxCalcBR empowers users to make informed financial decisions with minimal effort.
